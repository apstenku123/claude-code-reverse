/**
 * Creates a summary object for a user interaction event, aggregating key details such as duration, source, success status, error information, source URL, and any warnings.
 *
 * @param {Function} mapInteractionsToRouteNames - Processes an array of user interaction entries, mapping each to a route name and associated context (user, transaction, replay, etc).
 * @param {Function} addActivityIfNotFinished - Adds a new activity to the internal stack only if the process has not been marked as finished.
 * @param {number} duration - The duration of the user interaction event, typically generated by generateRandomNumberUpToSixteen.
 * @param {Function} startUiActionClickTransaction - Starts a new 'ui.action.click' idle transaction for tracing user interactions, ensuring no conflicting transactions are active and attaching relevant metadata.
 * @param {string} sourceUrl - The URL from which the user interaction originated.
 * @param {Array} warnings - An array of warning messages or objects related to the interaction.
 * @returns {Object} An object summarizing the user interaction event.
